            <h2>Shubman Gill sends loud message to selectors regarding Rohit Sharma, Virat Kohli’s place in India’s 2027
                World Cup squad</h2>

                <p1>
                    India's ODI captain Shubman Gill affirmed Rohit Sharma and Virat Kohli's crucial roles for the 2027
                    World Cup, citing their unique skillsets and experience.
                    Newly-appointed India ODI captain Shubman Gill has made his stance clear on the ongoing speculation
                    surrounding the future of senior stars Rohit Sharma and Virat Kohli in the 50-over format, stating
                    unequivocally that the Indian team “needs them" in the 2027 ODI World Cup.

                <p1>Newly-appointed India ODI captain Shubman Gill has made his stance clear on the ongoing speculation
                    surrounding the future of senior stars Rohit Sharma and Virat Kohli in the 50-over format, stating
                    unequivocally that the Indian team “needs them" in the 2027 ODI World Cup. <br>


                    Speaking ahead of the second Test against the West Indies, set to begin in New Delhi on Friday, Gill
                    addressed swirling questions about whether India is preparing to move on from the Rohit-Kohli era in
                    ODIs.

                    “Yes, definitely,” Gill said when asked whether he sees Rohit Sharma and Virat Kohli play a big role
                    in the next 50-over World Cup. <br>

                    Gill said the experience and skillset of both Kohli and Rohit can't be found easily.

                    “The experience that both of them have and the matches that they have won for India, there are very
                    few players who have won so many matches for India. And the players who have such skills and
                    qualities, and the players who have such skills and qualities with this experience are very few.
                    There are very few players in the world who have so much skill, quality and experience. So, in that
                    sense, yes,” he said.

                    Both Rohit and Kohli have retired from T20 Internationals and Test cricket, leaving ODIs as the only
                    format they are currently available for. While Kohli is presently in London and Rohit is at his
                    Mumbai residence, both are expected to join the ODI squad in New Delhi before the team departs for
                    Australia on October 15.

                    Gill, 25, who will lead India in the upcoming three-match ODI series against Australia starting
                    October 19, said he hopes to bring the same “calmness” to the dressing room that his predecessor
                    Rohit Sharma instilled during his leadership tenure.</p1>
